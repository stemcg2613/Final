      <h2>Meeting my first Bluebird</h2>
      <p>This is a journal about the first time I sat face to face with a beautiful bluebird. In the next paragraph, I will go into more detail about why that is one of the most important things that has ever happened to me.</p>
      <p>It wasn't an oridnary day for me on November 9th, 2022. I had just come home from the NICU and it was the 9th day that I was lucky enough to spend with my first born child. His name is Walker Joel, and he will forever by son.
      My wife and I had been told hours prior, that our son had suffered a grade 4 brain bleed, and that the chances for survival were very slim. I stepped outside to get some fresh air and then it happened, the most beautiful eastern bluebird landed on the fence
      to my right and just sat there. He stared into my soul for about 2 full minutes, and then flew away. I knew at that moment, my son has finally found his peace. It was the most symbolic moment of my life, and I will never forget it.</p>

      <h2>Life after death</h2>
      <p>This is a journal about how to battle sadness in loss.</p>
      <p>As much as I would like to write an actual journal about this, lets use this as an example for the project. This is where I would go in depth about the struggles and lessons learned. Thanks!</p>
